### Programming Language Concepts

Programming Language Concepts requires the creation of four programming projects, each created in a different language. These problems utilize various programming algorithms in order to solve them. A brief description of each problem will be featured below:

## 1. Spread of Endemics ([Link](spread_of_epidemics))
#### Language: Fortran
- Mathematically calculates the number of people infected in an endemic
- Utilizes Newton's Method for the calculation
## 2. Color of Flags ([Link](color_of_flags))
#### Language: Kotlin
- Grabs image files of flags from the Internet and parses them
- Utilizes Euclidean distance to compute the closest color for each pixel
## 3. Can you hear me now? ([Link](can_you_hear_me))
#### Language: Ada
- Uses a doubly-linked list package to represent a graph of cell towers
- Runs breadth-first search to check if one cell tower can reach another
## 4. Tautology Checker ([Link](tautology_checker))
#### Language: Haskell
- Turns logical phrases written in post-fix notation into trees
- Converts these logical statements to canonical normal form
- Checks if a given logic statement is a tautology or not
